# Portfolio Website

## Project Summary

Welcome to my portfolio website! I've built this modern, responsive web application to showcase my work as a passionate Front-End Web Developer and UI/UX enthusiast. This site serves as my digital gateway where potential clients, employers, and collaborators can discover my diverse range of projects, technical skills, and professional journey in web development.

As a developer, I understand the importance of having a strong professional online presence in today's competitive tech landscape. That's why I've created a website that not only demonstrates my technical capabilities but also reflects my design sensibilities, attention to detail, and commitment to user experience excellence. My portfolio provides a professional, accessible, and engaging platform that effectively communicates my technical expertise while maintaining modern web standards.

Built with React 19, Vite, and modern web technologies, my portfolio features a sophisticated single-page architecture with dynamic routing. Visitors can explore many of my distinct projects. The site includes advanced features like intelligent sticky header navigation, seamless dark/light theme switching, interactive 3D profile image effects, and comprehensive project galleries with detailed case studies. I've also prioritized accessibility with ARIA labels, semantic HTML structure, keyboard navigation support, and mobile-optimized responsive design to ensure optimal viewing experiences across all devices.
